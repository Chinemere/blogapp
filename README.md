# blogapp
This is a dynamic blog application where you can write interesting stories about how you see the world.

This app is still in pregress though, but it currenctly has features where you can create an account, login to your account and read stories that you are interested in.

If you do not have an account with us, You would only be able to read stories, You will not be able to create a post of your own or edit any author's post at that.

Each author is addressed by their username.

You can see who created what and when the post was made.

With time, the blog application will have its full features where readers can comment and do other interesting stuff on the application.

Feel free to leave a comment on my overall performance. it will encourage and help me improve.

This is like my first ever complete or almost complete working application, definitely irrelevant, but just thought to drop it here.
